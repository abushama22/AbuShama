Recommended Path for You (if goal = Cloud + DevOps role):

Pick one primary cloud (e.g., AWS Solutions Architect Associate â†’ AWS DevOps Engineer Pro).

Add Kubernetes (CKA) and Terraform (since almost every DevOps engineer uses them).

If youâ€™re on Azure â†’ aim for AZ-104 + AZ-400.

If on GCP â†’ ACE + Professional DevOps Engineer.

ðŸ‘‰ Abu, since you already did GCP ACE and are learning AWS Associate Architect, Iâ€™d suggest:

Next â†’ AWS DevOps Engineer â€“ Professional or CKA

Parallel â†’ Terraform Associate

Then â†’ Azure AZ-400 (to be multi-cloud strong)

Do you want me to make a roadmap (6â€“12 months)
